# Canadian_life_satisfaction_analysis

This repo contains the data and R code for the logistic analysis of Canadians' satisfaction of life. It was created by Zhixing Hong, Lingyue Kong and Jiayuan Pan. The aim of this report is presenting the factors that would influence Canadians' satisfaction towards life and presenting the logistic model. As some data is not allowed to share in public, we documented how to get them below. The section of the repo are: inputs, outputs, and scripts.
